# A function is a useful device that groups together a set of statements so they can be run more than once
#can also let us specify parameters that can serve as inputs to the function
# ALso allows us not to have repeatedly write the same code again and again
#Buiding blocks when constructing larger and amounts of codes to solve problems
#def inbuilt key word
def name_of_function():
    pass

#another example
def my_addition_func(arg1,agr2):
    print arg1 + agr2
my_addition_func(1,2)
3 #results

#docstring
def greetings(name):
    print "Hello" + name
    greetings ('Diana')
    Hello, Diana #results

  #the return statement, returns a result that can be stored as a variable
def greetings(name):
    print "Hello" + name
def add_num(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2
print add_num(2,3)
5 #results

#we dont declare variable types in python, e.g var = 'int

#we gona use break, continue and pass
